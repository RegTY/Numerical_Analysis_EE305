# Numerical_Analysis_EE305
This repo contains Jupyter Notebook as well as python files which will visually show the inner workings of different numerical analysis

The different methods provided are based on what was thought in the course "Numerical Analysis" at UCSI University, and are mainly developed by a student of the course therefore any mistakes in the explanation please do contact me to allow me for correction.

The purpose of this repo is to allow students with a better understanding of how different numerical methods work such as "bracketting" , "open method" and many more by providing an interactive and visual representation of the different iterative process.


# To-Do
1. Visualize the method for Huen and Euler's Method
2. Include rest of the regression models learnt
3. Add visual showcase of taylor/maclaurin series for approximation
